HTTP Methods
============

- ``GET`` will retrieve all data for the resource, according to the options indicated in the headers.
- ``HEAD`` will return only the header for a resource, according to the options indicated in the
    headers sent to the server. This includes metadata about the requested resource(s), like the
    database fields and links to other Web sources that are available.
- ``OPTIONS`` will return the methods and header-metadata that will work with a resource (i.e.,
    either the header-metadata that are applicable to a resource type, or the header-metadata that
    have valid values for that particular resource).
- ``SEARCH`` will help you search.
